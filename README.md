# sciform

This package can be used to nicely format floats into scientific 
presentation formats. Features include fixed point, and decimal and binary 
scientific and engineering notations. Where possible, formatting follows 
documented standards such as those published by 
[BIPM](https://www.bipm.org/en/) or [IEC](https://iec.ch/homepage).
