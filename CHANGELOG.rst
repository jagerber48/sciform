This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

----

Unreleased
----------

Added
^^^^^

* Added separate flags for code coverage reports for each python
  version.
* Added pip cache in github action.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Renamed ``fill_char`` to ``left_pad_char``.
  [`#126 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/126>`_]

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug where value/uncertainty pairs formatted in the
  ``"parts_per"`` format with zero exponent would appear with redundant
  parentheses, e.g. ``"(1.2 ± 0.1)"``.
  [`#130 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/130>`_]

----

0.32.3 (2024-01-11)
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Added more PyPi classifiers.

0.32.2 (2024-01-11)
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Expanded the "Under Construction" section of the readme and the
  "How to Contribute" section of the project page.
  Changes included adding links to the ``sciform`` feedback survey.
* Added examples in the documentation demonstrating how ``sciform``
  formatting can be mapped over collections of numbers.
  [`#120 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/120>`_]

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Refactor backend mode literal (used for typing) and enum (used
  internally for tracking options) object names so that e.g.
  ``SignMode`` -> ``SignModeEnum`` and ``UserSignMode`` -> ``SignMode``.
  [`#111 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/111>`_]

----

0.32.0 (2024-01-10)
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Previously it was impossible to configure ``pdg_sig_figs=True``
  together with ``ndigits!=AutoDigits``.
  This combinations resulted in an exception.
  Now behavior has been defined and implemented for this combination.
  For single value formatting the value of ``pdg_sig_figs`` is always
  ignored.
  For value/uncertainty formatting ``ndigits`` is ignored if
  ``pdg_sig_figs=True``.
  The behavior for ``pdg_sig_figs=False`` is unchanged.
  [`#73 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/73>`_]

Removed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Removed ``global_add_c_prefix``,
  ``global_add_small_si_prefixes``, ``global_add_ppth_form``,
  ``global_reset_si_prefixes``, ``global_reset_iec_prefixes``, and
  ``global_reset_parts_per_forms``.
  These options are redundant with ``set_global_defaults`` and
  ``GlobalDefaultsContext`` and make the extra translations dictionaries
  more confusing to understand.
  [`#97 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/97>`_]

Changed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Previously ``12.3`` would format as ``"12.3e+00"``
  when using parts per formatting mode.
  Now, when using parts per formatting mode, the ``e+00`` exponent is
  translated to be an empty string so that ``12.3`` would format as
  ``"12.3"``.
  [`#99 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/99>`_]

----

0.31.1 (2024-01-06)
-------------------

Removed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Removed the ``SciNumUnc`` class. Now the ``SciNum``
  class can be used with an optional second positional argument to
  specify the uncertainty associated with a number.

* **[BREAKING]** Remove separator configuration from the FSML.
  These options made the FSML to cumbersome and led to confusing
  (if not incorrect) conflicts with the round mode symbol.
  Now all separator configuration needs to be done by setting the
  global format options or using the global format options context
  manager.
  [`#29 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/29>`_]

Added
^^^^^

* Added annotated examples demonstrating the FSML.
* Added more documentation for contributing developers.
* Added `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ configuration.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Renamed multiple options.

    * ``top_dig_place`` renamed to ``left_pad_dec_place``.
    * ``superscript_exp`` renamed to ``superscript``.
    * ``bracket_unc`` renamed to ``paren_uncertainty``.
    * ``bracket_unc_remove_seps`` renamed to
      ``paren_uncertainty_separators``. This change is associated with a
      a reversal of the Boolean logic on the option.
    * ``val_unc_match_widths`` renamed to ``left_pad_matching``.
    * ``unc_pm_whitespace`` renamed to ``pm_whitespace``.

* **[BREAKING]** Previously specifying any left pad decimal place using
  the ``sciform`` FSML resulted in setting ``left_pad_matching=True`` so
  that ``print(f"{SciNum(123.456, 0.789):0}")`` resulted in
  ``"123.456 ± 000.789"``.
  Now the FSML has no impact on ``left_pad_matching``.
  Now, similar to many other options, the global setting for
  ``left_pad_matching`` will always be used when formatting using the
  FSML.
  Under the default global options (``left_pad_matching=False``)
  ``print(f"{SciNum(123.456, 0.789):0}")`` results in
  ``"123.456 ± 0.789"``.
* Implemented `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_ linting and
  formatting in codebase and integration automation.
* Refactored code for adding separators.
* Refactored formatting and formatting utilities to simplify functions
  and make the algorithm easier to follow.
* More aggressively filter JetBrains ``.idea/`` folder from version control.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug involving removing separators in parentheses uncertainty
  mode when at least one of the value and uncertainty were non-finite.

----

0.30.1 (2023-11-24)
-------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed Changelog.

----

0.30.0 (2023-11-24)
-------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Remove the ``FormatOptions`` class from the user
  interface. Now users configure ``Formatter`` instances by passing the
  formatting keyword arguments into the ``Formatter`` constructor
  directly. Global configuration via ``set_global_defaults()`` or the
  ``GlobalDefaultsContext`` is also done by passing formatting keywords
  directly. This change reduces the amount of boilerplate code and
  keystrokes needed to use ``sciform``.
* **[BREAKING]** Options such as ``exp_mode`` and ``exp_format`` were
  previously configured using ``Enum`` objects such as ``ExpMode`` or
  ``ExpFormat``. Now these options are configured using string literals.
  This change also reduces the amount of boilerplate code and keystrokes
  needed to use ``sciform``.
* Clean up ``print_global_defaults`` output. This is the start of an
  effort to improve interface for getting and printing current format
  options.

Added
^^^^^

* Added code of conduct.
* Added contributing guidelines.
* Added Python 3.12 to automated testing.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Cleaned up API documentation.
* Fixed a bug where the ``repr`` for ``FormatOptions`` would return a
  string containing information about the global format options rather
  than about the specific ``FormatOptions`` instance.
  [`#75 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/75>`_]
* Fixed an issue that was causing Github actions code coverage report to
  not actually check code coverage.
  [`#84 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/84>`_]

Removed
^^^^^^^

* **[BREAKING]** Removed the ``unicode_pm`` feature which allowed
  toggling between using ``'+/-'`` or ``'±'`` in value/uncertainty
  strings. Previously ``unicode_pm`` defaulted to ``False`` so that
  ``'+/-'`` was the default behavior. Now the default behavior is to use
  ``'±'`` and there is no way to change to the old ``'+/-'`` behavior.
  [`#10 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/discussions/10>`_]

----

0.29.1 (2023-10-22)
-------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug where bracket uncertainties erroneously appeared as
  empty parentheses for zero or non-finite uncertainties.
  [`#66 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/66>`_]
* Fixed a bug where the exponent value was erroneously calculated
  from the uncertainty rather than the value when the value was
  negative (but larger in magnitude than the uncertainty).
  [`#68 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/68>`_]
* Fixed a bug where certain leading digits were erroneously not
  stripped from the uncertainty when using bracket uncertainty with
  negative values.
  [`#68 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/68>`_]
* Fixed a bug where the value was erroneously being rounded
  according to the PDG rounding rules when ``pdg_sig_figs=True``,
  the uncertainty was zero or non-finite, and the value was
  positive. [`#71 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/71>`_]
* Fixed a bug where a spurious error was raised when
  ``pdg_sig_figs=True``, the uncertainty was zero or non-finite, and
  the value was zero or negative.
  [`#65 <https://github.com/jagerber48/sciform/issues/65>`_]

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Replace ``-e .`` with ``.`` in ``requirements.txt``. There is no need
  to install ``sciform`` in editable mode for code automation routines.

----

0.29.0 (2023-09-05)
-------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Previously, when using ``bracket_unc=True`` with any exponent string
  (such as ``e-06``, ``μ`` or ``ppm``), the value and uncertainty were
  always wrapped in parentheses, e.g. ``(1.03(25))e-06``,
  ``(1.03(25)) μ`` or ``(1.03(25)) ppm``.
  Now, when using ``bracket_unc=True`` with prefix or parts-per exponent
  format modes, if the exponent is replaced with an alphabetic
  replacement, then the value and uncertainty are no longer wrapped in
  parentheses, e.g. ``1.03(25) μ`` and ``1.03(25) ppm``.
  This is consistent with
  `BIPM Guide Section 7.2.2 <https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/2071204/JCGM_100_2008_E.pdf/cb0ef43f-baa5-11cf-3f85-4dcd86f77bd6#page=37>`_.
  Specifically, any time ``bracket_unc=False`` the value and uncertainty
  are always wrapped in parentheses, and any time notation like ``e+02``
  or ``b+02`` is used to indicate the exponent then the value and
  uncertainty are always wrapped in parentheses.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Correct ``fit_plot_with_sciform.py`` example script to use new
  ``exp_format=ExpFormat.PREFIX`` instead of old ``prefix_exp=True``.

Improved
^^^^^^^^

* Documentation improvements including typos and neatening up changelog.

----

0.28.2 (2023-08-31)
-------------------

Improved
^^^^^^^^

* General wording and grammar improvements throughout documentation.
* Include more usage examples in the examples documentation in addition
  to referring the reader to the test suite.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug when using ``pdg_sig_figs`` with uncertainties larger than
  about 1000 by cleaning up ``Decimal`` math.
* Previously, when formatting using the format specification
  mini-language, if the prefix exponent format flag was omitted then the
  exponent format was forced to ``ExpFormat.STANDARD`` rather than
  ``None``.
  This meant that it was impossible, using the format specification
  mini-language combined with global configuration options, to set
  ``ExpFormat.PARTS_PER``.
  Now when the prefix flag is omitted ``exp_format`` is set to ``None``
  so that it will be populated by the global default option.
  In the future a flag may be added to select "parts-per" formatting
  using the format specification mini-language.

----

0.28.1 (2023-08-28)
-------------------

* Make ``FormatOptions`` inputs ``Optional`` so that ``None`` inputs
  pass type checks.
* Write format-specification mini-language documentation to refer to
  existing format options documentation to avoid documentation
  duplication.
* Setup test coverage analysis automation and upload report to
  `codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/jagerber48/sciform>`_.
* Add package status badges to readme.
* Test against Python 3.11.
* List supported Python versions in ``pyproject.toml`` classifiers.

----

0.28.0 (2023-08-27)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** Replace ``prefix_exp`` and ``parts_per_exp`` options
  with an ``exp_format`` option which can be configured to
  ``ExpFormat.STANDARD``, ``ExpFormat.PREFIX`` or
  ``ExpFormat.PARTS_PER``.
* Previously formatting a non-finite number in percent mode would always
  display a ``'%'`` symbol, e.g. ``'(nan)%'``.
  Now the brackets and ``'%'`` symbol will be omitted unless
  ``nan_inf_exp=True``.
* In ``latex=True`` mode there is now a space between the number and a
  prefix or parts-per translated exponent.
  For value/uncertainty formatting the space is still absent.
  For ``latex=False`` there is still always a space for number and
  value/uncertainty formatting before the translated exponent string.
* In ``latex=True`` mode ``'nan'`` and ``'inf'`` strings are now wrapped
  in ``'\text{}'``.
* Refactored code for resolving exponent strings.
* Added more unit tests to reach 100% test coverage. Mostly added test
  cases for invalid internal inputs.
* Raise ``NotImplementedError`` when attempting value/uncertainty
  formatting with binary exponent modes.
  Rounding and truncating are not properly implemented in binary mode
  yet.

----

0.27.4 (2023-08-25)
-------------------

* Setup github action to automatically build and publish on release.

----

0.27.3 (2023-08-23)
-------------------

* Added ``Unreleased`` section to changelog.
* Removed ``version`` from source code.
  Project version is now derived from a git version tag using
  ``setuptools_scm``.
* Stopped encouraging ``import FormatOptions as Fo``.

----

0.27.2 (2023-08-20)
-------------------

* Add ``__repr__()`` for ``FormatOptions`` and
  ``RenderedFormatOptions``.

----

0.27.1 (2023-08-18)
-------------------

* Add ``examples/`` folder to hold example scripts used in the
  documentation as well as the input data for these scripts and their
  outputs which appear in the documentation.
* Remove extra ``readthedocs.yaml`` file.

----

0.27.0 (2023-08-18)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** Rename ``AutoRound`` to ``AutoDigits``. This is
  because, e.g., ``ndigits=AutoDigits`` sounds more correct than
  ``ndigits=AutoRound``. Furthermore, ``AutoRound`` could likely be
  confused as being an option for ``round_mode``, which it is not.

----

0.26.2 (2023-08-18)
-------------------

* Fix a bug where illegal options combinations could be realized at
  format time when certain global default objects were merged into
  certain user specified options.
  The bug is fixed by re-checking the options combinations after merging
  in the global defaults but before formatting.

----

0.26.1 (2023-08-18)
-------------------

* Add unit tests, increase test coverage.

----

0.26.0 (2023-08-15)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** Rename some format options to make their usage more
  clear.

   * ``exp`` to ``exp_val``
   * ``precision`` to ``ndigits``
   * ``RoundMode.PREC`` to ``RoundMode.DEC_PLACE``
   * ``AutoExp`` to ``AutoExpVal``
   * ``AutoPrec`` to ``AutoRound``

* Raise more exceptions for incorrect options combinations.

   * Raise an exception when using ``pdg_sig_figs`` with a user-supplied
     ``exp_val``.
   * Raise exceptions instead of warnings for invalid user-supplied
     ``exp_val`` in ``get_mantissa_base_exp()``.

* Minor refactor to ``GlobalDefaultsContext``.
* Documentation:

   * Update documentation to reflect name changes above.
   * Better centralization of ``float``/``Decimal`` information.
   * Better explanations of ``AutoExpVal`` and ``AutoRound`` behavior.
   * More accurate descriptions of some invalid options combinations.

----

0.25.2 (2023-08-11)
-------------------

* Update roadmap

----

0.25.1 (2023-08-10)
-------------------

* Refactor ``get_pdg_round_digit()`` into a dedicated function.

----

0.25.0 (2023-08-02)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** ``template`` option removed from ``FormatOptions``
  constructor.
  New ``FormatOptions`` instances can be constructed from two existing
  ``FormatOptions`` instances using the ``merge()`` method.
* Minor documentation improvements.

----

0.24.0 (2023-07-30)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** percent mode is now accessed via an exponent mode,
  ``ExpMode.PERCENT``.
  There is no longer a ``percent`` keyword argument.

----

0.23.0 (2023-07-29)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** Users now construct ``FormatOptions`` objects which
  they pass into ``Formatter`` objects and global configuration
  functions.
  ``Formatter`` and global configuration functions no longer accept bare
  keyword arguments to indicate formatting options.
* **[BREAKING]** ``Formatter`` now resolves un-filled format options
  from the global defaults at format time instead of initialization
  time.
  This is consistent with the previous behavior for ``SciNum`` and
  ``SciNumUnc`` objects.
* Change ``pyproject.toml`` description

----

0.22.2 (2023-07-27)
-------------------

* Add ``.readthedocs.yaml`` and update documentation
  ``requirements.txt`` for reproducible documentation builds.

----

0.22.1 (2023-07-27)
-------------------

* Fix a date typo in the changelog for the entry for version ``0.22.0``.

----

0.22.0 (2023-07-27)
-------------------

* **[BREAKING]** Rename ``sfloat`` to ``SciNum`` and ``vufloat`` to
  ``SciNumUnc``
* **[BREAKING]** ``SciNum`` instances do not support arithmetic
  operations the same way ``sfloat`` instances did.
  This functionality was removed for two reasons.
  First, ``SciNum`` uses ``Decimal`` to store its value instead of
  ``float`` and configuring ``SciNum`` to behave as a subclass of
  ``Decimal`` would require added complexity.
  Second, A decision has been made to keep the ``sciform`` module
  focussed solely on formatting individual numbers or pairs of numbers
  for early releases.
  Convenience functionality outside of this narrow scope will be
  considered at a later time.
* Favor ``Decimal`` methods over ``float`` methods in internal
  formatting algorithm code.
* Documentation

   * Remove ``float``-based language fom documentation.
   * Include a discussion in the documentation about ``Decimal`` versus
     ``float`` considerations that may be important for users.
   * Various minor revisions and edits. Notably a typo in the version
     ``0.21.0`` changelog entry that reversed the meaning of a sentence
     was corrected.
   * Add "under construction" message to README.

----

0.21.0 (2023-07-22)
-------------------

* Use ``Decimal`` under the hood for numerical formatting instead of
  ``float``. ``Decimal`` instances support higher precision than
  ``float`` and more reliable rounding behavior.
* Update particle data group uncertainty rounding unit tests since edge
  cases are now handled property as a result of adopting ``Decimal``.
* Minor cleanup of ``sfloat`` arithmetic functions.

----

0.20.1 (2023-06-24)
-------------------

* Refactor unit tests to use lists and tuples instead of dicts. Literal
  dicts allow the possibility for defining the same key (test case) with
  different values, only the latest of which will actually be tested.
  The refactoring ensures all elements of the test lists will be tested.
* Refactor ``sfloat`` and ``vufloat`` ``__format__()`` functions to call
  ``format_float()`` and ``format_val_unc()`` directly instead of
  creating a ``Formatter`` object first.

----

0.20.0 (2023-06-22)
-------------------

* Support passing ``None`` as a value into ``extra_si_prefixes``,
  ``extra_iec_prefixes``, or ``extra_parts_per_forms`` to prevent
  translation of a certain exponent value. This may be useful for
  suppressing ``ppb`` or similar local-dependent "parts per"
  translations.
* **[BREAKING]** Change the bracket uncertainty flag in the
  `FSML <fsml>`_ from ``'S'`` to ``'()'``.
* When an exponent translation mode is used in combination with Latex
  mode, the translated exponent will now be wrapped in a Latex text
  mode: e.g. ``\text{Mi}``.
* Link to test cases on examples page.

----

0.19.0 (2023-06-22)
-------------------

* Add python-package.yaml github workflows. Allows automated testing,
  doc testing, and flake8 scans during github pull requests.
* Minor flake8 cleanup

----

0.18.1 (2023-06-21)
-------------------

* Documentation improvements

----

0.18.0 (2023-06-19)
-------------------

* Add Particle Data Group significant figure auto selection feature,
  documentation, and tests.
* **[BREAKING]** Use the larger of value or uncertainty to resolve the
  exponent when formatting value/uncertainty pairs. The previous
  behavior was to always use the value to resolve the exponent, but this
  behavior was not convenient for the important use case of zero value
  with non-zero uncertainty.
* Expose ``AutoPrec`` and ``AutoExp`` sentinel classes so that users can
  explicitly indicate automatic precision and exponent selection.

----

0.17.1 (2023-06-19)
-------------------

* Code restructure to make formatting algorithm easier to follow
  including more verbose clarifying comments.
* Minor documentation cleanup

----

0.17.0 (2023-06-19)
-------------------

* Add parts-per notation feature, documentation, and tests.
* **[BREAKING]** Rename ``use_prefix`` option to ``prefix_exp``.
* Fix typos in binary IEC prefixes table.
* Fix some cross links in documentation.

----

0.16.0 (2023-06-18)
-------------------

* Add ``latex`` option with documentation and tests.
* Refactor exponent string conversion.
* Percent mode for non-finite numbers.

----

0.15.2 (2023-06-18)
-------------------

* Fix a bug involving space filling and separators.

----

0.15.1 (2023-06-17)
-------------------

* Changelog formatting typo.

----

0.15.0 (2023-06-17)
-------------------

* Add ``superscript_exp`` option with documentation and tests.
* Forbid percent mode unless using fixed point exponent mode.
* Add PyPi link to readme.

----

0.14.0 (2023-06-17)
-------------------

* Add Changelog.
* Add ``unicode_pm`` option with documentation and tests.
